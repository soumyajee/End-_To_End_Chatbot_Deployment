The \\ndisease name (meaning, “to siphon”) originated with the Greeks in 230 BC, and related \\nto the excessive urination and wasting that occurs with untreated diabetes. Early \\nclassifications of diabetes are credited to the Susrata of the Hindus, the father of \\nmedicine in India. Later, classifications of diabetes mellitus (mellitus is Latin for “honey-\\nsweet”) are refined, and suggested treatments vary from the removal of diuretic food to \\ntaking tepid baths. \\nDuring the 19th  Century, Claude Bernard theorized glycogenolysis as connected to the \\ncause of diabetes mellitus. By the 1920’s scientists recognized insulin’s role in the \\nregulation of blood glucose. Today the pathophysiology of diabetes is more clearly \\nunderstood yet the cure remains elusive (ADA 2017).'),\n",

Cellular plasma \\nmembrane’s permeability to glucose varies according to type of tissue. Glucose \\ntransporters control diffusion of glucose into the cell. These transporters are specific to \\neach type of tissue. Hormonal and neural devices control homeostasis of blood glucose \\nlevels. At least eight hormones secreted by various endocrine glands play a role in \\nblood glucose levels. \\nInsulin (secreted by the pancreas) is the chief glucose regulatory hormone. Insulin is \\nsynthesized  by  beta  cells  (ß-cells)  located  in  the  islets  of  Langerhans.  Insulin \\ndecreases blood glucose levels though increased glycogenesis and the transport of \\nglucose into muscle, liver and adipose tissue. Muscle, liver and adipose cells require \\nactivation by insulin at insulin receptors in order to facilitate glucose transport into the \\ncell. Neural tissue and erythrocytes do not require insulin for glucose utilization. Once \\nglucose has entered the cell, it may be oxidized for energy (glycolysis) or stored \\n(glycogenesis) in the muscle or liver (See Figure 1) (ADA 2017).'),\n",

Alongside this and the \\nlimited research and information present at the time of formulating the current system, \\nthe designations related with the different types of diabetes are vague and inaccurate. \\nDue to this fact and current evidence-based practice, there is a call to revise the current \\nclassification of diabetes mellitus and focus on a β-cell centric classification schema, \\naccording to a new article published online in Diabetes Care Jan. 21, 2016.  Based on \\nnew research performed by Stanley Schwartz and affiliates, there is a new proposition \\nfor using a β-cell centered model for diabetes, which supports the notion that all \\ndiabetes originates from an abnormal pancreatic β-cell. Type 1 diabetes has been \\nthought of as an ailment of low insulin production, while type 2 has usually been of \\ninsulin resistance. This discrepancy is not clear or helpful. Schwartz and colleagues \\nsuppose all diabetes is a product of impairment to beta cells (which produce insulin) and \\naccording to this theory, insulin resistance just reveals the rudimentary deficiency in \\ninsulin production. Only one-third of individuals with insulin resistance will go on to \\ndevelop diabetes. The basis of the new classification system is treatment of patients as \\nindividuals though currently most prescribers will initiate treatment based on a diagnosis \\ninstead of the person. Schwartz believes that diabetes is rooted to β-cell and because of \\nthis, classification of diabetes types should be based on causes of that damage so \\nphysicians will know how to go about treatment.

Without insulin, muscle and adipose cells \\ncannot  access  glucose  to   meet  energy  requirements.  Glucose  production  goes \\nunopposed in the liver. Glucagon is produced in response to the glucose deprivation of \\nmuscle and adipose tissues, prompting glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glucose \\nlevels rise in the blood. \\nThe kidneys cannot absorb the ever-increasing glucose, so the excess is excreted in \\nthe urine (polyuria). The brain, prompted by this loss of fluid, signals thirst (polydypsia) \\nand hunger  (polyphagia).  If  this  process  continues,  stored  fats  are  metabolized  \\nand transformed by the liver into keto acids, which leads to lower pH levels and \\nacidosis. The drop in pH level and loss of ketones in urine signals the onset of \\nketoacidosis. \\nIntracellular potassium ions are exchanged for hydrogen ions. These potassium ions \\nare lost in urine along with sodium, magnesium and phosphorus. Blood volume drops, \\nincreasing hematocrit, hemoglobin and white blood cell counts. Respiratory \\ncompensation results in labored, deep respiration (Kussmaul respiration) in an attempt \\nto lower the PCO2 values. \\nThis  process  is  acute  but  may  extend  over  several  days.

Prevalence of Type 1 is estimated to \\nbe approximately 1.25 million American children and adults. This includes that 40,000 \\nnew type 1 diabetes cases are recorded each year in the United States.  29.1 million \\nAmericans, or 9.3% of the population, had diabetes. Of the 29.1 million, 21.0 million \\nwere diagnosed, and 8.1 million were undiagnosed. (American Diabetes Association, \\n2013-last edited 2017.) Worldwide incidence rates vary from 1.7/100,000 in Japan to \\n29.5/100,000 in Finland. The incidence of Type 1 is on the increase (ADA, 2017). \\nAge \\nDiagnosis is most commonly made in individuals between the ages of 5-20. Generally, \\nonset of Type 1 occurs under the age of 30 but can happen at any age. Peak incidence \\nof Type 1 is at puberty. This age pattern is consistent across world populations. Age-\\nrelated factors may include growth spurts, hormonal changes and exposure to infectious \\nagents (ADA, 2003) Bell, 1997). \\nGender \\nGender does not seem to be a factor in the incidence of Type 1 (ADA, 2017). \\nGeographic Distribution \\nFinland, Sweden and Sardinia, Italy have the highest incidence rate of Type 1. \\nCountries with intermediate rates of Type 1 include Caucasians in the US, New Zealand \\nand Spain. The lowest rates of Type 1 incidence occur in Mexico, Chile and Japan. \\nIncidence rates vary within countries and may increase in areas with colder climates  \\n(ADA, 2017) (Anthony, Thibodeau, Prezbindowski, 1979). \\n Race/Ethnicity \\nThe incidence of Type 1 is greater among Caucasians than African Americans, \\nHispanics, Asians and Native Americans (ADA, 2017). \\nFamilial Factors \\nCaucasians, native to North America, who are first-degree relatives to a diagnosed \\nType 1 diabetic are 1 to 15% more likely to have Type 1 themselves. \\nThe American Diabetes Association assesses the risk of developing Type 1 to be \\nbetween 10%-25% if both parents have Type 1.

More than 80% of cases occur in persons without a \\nfamily history of diabetes. The remaining 20% have a familial link to diabetes (ADA, \\n2017). \\nOther Risk Factors \\nSeveral other factors that may promote onset of Type 1 include, but are not limited to: \\n• diet (decreased length of breast feeding, early introduction of cow’s milk, \\nmalnutrition) \\n• exposure to certain viruses such as coxsakie B4 or congenital rubella. \\nIt is clear that the onset of Type 1 is multifactoral. These factors may differ among \\nracial/ethnic groups and there may be many more, yet undiscovered causative agents \\nof Type 1 (ADA, 2017). \\n Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 \\nType 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. Decreased production and \\nutilization of insulin characterizes Type 2 diabetes. Unlike Type 1, the body does \\nproduce insulin, but cannot use it effectively (insulin resistance). Insulin resistance and \\nthe relative lack of insulin production result in Type 2. Type 2 diabetics may or may not \\nneed to inject insulin during their lifetime. Although the exact cause is unknown, Type 2 \\nis considered a disease of genetic predisposition with additional causal factors \\nprompting onset. Type 2 does not involve an autoimmune destruction of ß-cells. The \\nidentification of several risk factors has been a positive step in the fight against Type 2. \\nIt is unknown whether focusing on intervention strategies based solely on non-genetic \\nrisk factors will result in a cure (ADA, 2017) (Anthony, Thibodeau, et. al. 1979) (Bruno, \\nMerletti, et al 1990). \\nEtiology (Risk Factors) \\nFamily History/Genetic Risk \\nAn individual with a family member diagnosed with Type 2 is at greater risk for \\ndeveloping diabetes himself or herself.

If both parents have a Type 2 diagnosis the risk \\nto offspring is 50% (ADA, 2017) (Anthony, Thibodeau, et. al. 1979) (Hoehns, Skelly, \\nGraber, 1997). \\n“As many as 20%-60% of people in the general population may be genetically \\nsusceptible to Type 2 diabetes” (Harris, 2017) Several “candidate genes” have been \\ndiscovered and linked to the inheritance of Type 2.

The risk increases dramatically \\nafter the age of 40. Specifically, those aged 65-74 years are at highest risk.  However, \\nonset of Type 2 under the age of 30 is becoming more common. High-risk groups are \\nmore likely to develop Type 2 at an earlier age (Hoehns, Skelly, Graber, 1997). \\nGender \\nThere is no significant difference related to gender (ADA, 2017). \\n Race/Ethnicity & Geographic Distribution \\nRisk for developing Type 2 is higher for: \\n• Native Americans \\n• Pacific Islanders \\n• African-Americans \\n• Hispanics \\n• Asian Americans \\nType 2 is strongly linked to western cultures.

(Hoehns, Skelly, Graber, 1997). \\nObesity \\nConsidered a strong risk factor, obesity places many at risk. Location of body fat \\n(abdominal) and duration of obesity are believed to be significant in increasing risk. The \\ncombination of obesity and a family history of diabetes are considered to greatly \\nincrease the incidence of Type 2 (ADA, 2017) (Hoehns, Skelly, Graber, 1997). \\nOther Risk Factors \\n• Diet-Mostly believed to  be  related to  total calorie intake versus the individual \\ncomponents of food. \\n• Physical  Activity-Because  higher  insulin  activity  is  associated  with \\nphysical activity, those with active lifestyles are less likely to develop Type 2 \\n(ADA, 2017).'),\n",

Insulin \\nresistance is  a  decreased responsiveness to  sufficient  concentration of  insulin.  The \\nprimary causes of insulin resistance are considered genetics and weight gain. This first \\nphase of resistance stimulates an increase in insulin production by ß-cells. ß-cells are \\nunable to make enough insulin to meet the body’s perceived need. As the insulin \\nresistance continues hyperglycemia ensues. ß-cell failure due to “exhaustion” or \\n“glucose toxicity”  is  believed  to  follow.  Autoimmune destruction  of  ß-cells  does  not  \\noccur  in individuals with Type 2 (ADA, 2017) (Bruno, Merletti, et al, 1990). \\nAlthough similar to the scenario of Type 1, Type 2 is not identical in its pathophysiologic \\nprocess.

It is \\nnecessary to more carefully monitor blood glucose levels during illness or when taking \\ndrugs than alter insulin secretion (such as phenytoin, steroids, pentamidine etc.) \\n(Holdren and Patton, 1993) (Katz, Wirthlin et al, 1991). \\nThe procedure for testing varies slightly depending on the SMBG method used. A small \\ndrop of blood is obtained (usually by pricking the fingertip with a lancing device) and \\napplied to a small plastic strip. Chemicals on the strip change color when it comes in \\ncontact with sugar. Photometric meters use a light source with filters and a lens to \\ndetect color changes. Most meters detect glucose electrochemically. In this method a \\ncurrent is produced when glucose in the blood reacts with the test strip to give a glucose \\nreading in mg/dl.\"),\n",

These changes include thickening of the basement \\nmembrane, narrowing of capillary lumen, and stasis in microcirculation. Similar to the \\nchanges seen in other body tissues, these events might lessen the amount of nutrients \\ndelivered and waste eliminated from the tissue resulting in a weakened host response \\nto bacteria (Lundstrom, Mordes, Rossini, 1997) Maffie-Lee and Fitzgerals, 1995) (Med \\nSci, 1996). \\nCollagen Metabolism \\nMetabolism of collagen in diabetics is shown to be abnormal.

If emergency surgery is necessary, \\nthe patient should be treated in a facility where they can easily be monitored, such as a \\nhospital. Consultation with the physician prior to providing any dental therapy for these \\nindividuals is recommended (FDA, 2017) (Low and GEnco, 1995) (Lunstrom, Mordes, \\nRossini 1997). \\nThe amount of stress the individual feels during the dental appointment can greatly \\naffect the patient’s ability to tolerate the procedure. Therefore, patients should not be \\nkept waiting. Thorough explanations of dental procedures to be performed may also \\nhelp to reduce stress. \\nIt is better to plan for dental treatment during a time of high glucose and low insulin \\nactivity. Individuals with Type 1 generally do better if appointed in the morning after \\nconsuming  a  normal  breakfast.  This  is  due  to  something  known  as  the  Dawn \\nPhenomenon.  There is an elevation in circulating blood glucose in the morning due to \\nbreakdown of stored energy supplies in the pre-dawn hours.  This is thought to be a \\nresponse to the prolonged fasting that occurs overnight (Zagaria, 2003). \\nPatients should be instructed to maintain their currently prescribed drug regimen. \\nAdjustments in diet and insulin therapy may be necessary if the patient undergoes \\nsignificant dental treatment. It is important to maintain proper nutritional balance and \\npatients should be instructed to eat following their dental appointment. Understanding \\nthe patient’s drug regimen assists the dental professional in planning and scheduling \\ndental treatment (FDA. 2017) (Lundstrom, Mordes, Rossini, 1997). \\nThe use of local anesthesia is not contraindicated in diabetic patients. Local anesthesia \\nshould contain no more than 1:100,000 epinephrine. Avoidance of excessive amounts \\nof epinephrine is necessary in order to prevent increased blood glucose levels (FDA, \\n2017) (Loe and Genco, 1995). \\nAlterations in food and drug intake should be considered when conscious sedation is \\nnecessary during dental treatment. Consultation with the physician is suggested prior to \\ninitiating dental treatment involving IV sedation. \\nIf diabetic patients are to undergo emergency oral surgery or periodontal treatment, the \\nuse of prophylactic antibiotics should be considered. In controlled and uncontrolled \\ndiabetics, poor host response and delayed wound healing may prompt the use of \\nantibiotics. However, the use of antibiotics is not generally necessary in controlled \\ndiabetic patients for routine procedures. Use of antibiotics in conjunction with dental \\ntreatment of diabetics is highly variable according to the patient’s glycemic control. \\nAdministration, dose and selection of an antibiotic are usually the same as in \\nnondiabetic patients.

Many factors can \\npredispose an individual to a hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic episode. Dental \\nprofessionals should be aware of emergency medical procedures necessary to manage \\na diabetic emergency. Patients with diagnosed diabetes mellitus should be encouraged \\nto bring self-monitoring glucose devices and a carbohydrate liquid drink to their dental \\noffice (FDA, 2017).

Most  diabetics  begin  to  have  symptoms  when  the  blood  glucose  level  \\nfalls  below 70mg/dL. Persons with longstanding type 1 diabetes may have decreased \\nability to sense impending hypoglycemia (Oliver and Tellervo, 1993). \\nSymptoms of hypoglycemia may include: \\n• Headache \\n• Hunger \\n• Moist skin \\n• Pallor \\n• Weakness \\n• Dizziness \\n• Anxiety \\n• Confusion \\nIf  left  untreated  these  symptoms  may  progress  to  severe  hypoglycemia,  loss  of \\nconsciousness leading to seizures and possible death (FDA, 2017) (Cherry-Pepper, \\nSorkin, et al 1992). \\nHypoglycemic episodes may be experienced by individuals who (Cherry-Pepper, \\nSorkin, et al 1992):  \\n• take insulin or oral diabetes medications \\n• follow an intensified insulin protocol (target glucose level near normal) \\n• have delayed or decreased food intake'),\n",

Patients may be \\naware of hypoglycemic symptomology before the dental professional. At this point, the \\ndiabetic individual may self-test for blood glucose level and/or eat something containing \\nsugar. The dental professional should encourage diabetic patients to communicate \\nchanges in their condition that might signal onset of hypoglycemia. \\nIf the individual is experiencing hypoglycemia they should consume 10 to15 grams of \\nrapidly absorbable carbohydrates. \\nExamples include: \\n• 3 glucose tablets \\n• 4 oz. fruit juice \\n• 5-7 hard candies \\n• 8 oz. milk \\n• 1 tablespoon of sugar or sugar cube \\n• 4 oz. of a regular soft drink (not diet) \\n• cake icing \\nRepeated if necessary in fifteen minutes. \\nSymptoms may arise rapidly and it may become necessary for the dental professional \\nto administer some form of oral carbohydrate (e.g., orange juice, and candy).

In a February 2017 online article titled, An Early Signpost \\nforTtype 1 Diabetes? by Jennifer Couzin-Frankel, reveals astounding research, done by \\nEzio Bonifacio, a biologist at the Technische Universität Dresden in Germany, and his \\ncolleagues, which is able to determine preliminary markers in T cells found in infants \\nand children which can lead to Type 1 diabetes. \\nCouzin-Frankel explains, “Type 1 diabetes hits when the body destroys insulin-\\nproducing cells in the pancreas. By the time people—many of them children—are \\ndiagnosed, most of those cells are gone. Forty thousand new type 1 diabetes cases are \\nrecorded each year in the United States, and the disease is on the rise for reasons not \\nwell understood. A dream for diabetes researchers is to treat kids earlier, when they are \\nheaded down the diabetes road but aren’t yet there. \\n About 3 decades ago, scientists discovered a collection of signposts: antibodies \\ndirected at certain proteins in the body, including insulin. As they studied these children \\nmore intensively, they learned that those with two or more different kinds of these \\nautoantibodies will eventually develop diabetes, though sometimes not for many years. \\nMany clinical trials have since focused on trying to slow disease onset in these \\nindividuals. \\nBut what happens before these autoantibodies arise? Ezio Bonifacio had the means to \\ntackle this question. He and his colleagues had for years been following children since \\nbirth whose genetics and family history put them at increased risk. Beginning in 2000, \\nthe researchers began to collect and store blood cells from a subset of these children. \\nRecently, technology had advanced to the point that scientists could analyze single cells \\nin those samples. \\n‘We decided that it was time to start to see if there was something happening at the \\nlevel of the T cells,’ Bonifacio says. Commonly referred to as the sentries of our immune \\nsystem, T cells are the villains in diabetes. They for some reason go rogue, leading the \\nattack on insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. \\nBonifacio and his colleagues performed sophisticated analysis on T cells from 12 babies \\nwho didn’t develop autoantibodies later—suggesting they were in the clear—and 16 \\nbabies who did. Probing the T cells in the lab, they saw that cells from the children who \\ncontinued down the path toward type 1 diabetes were not normal. Essentially, when the\"),\n",

This is a \\nfaint echo of what happens inside the body of someone developing diabetes: Their T \\ncells are activated against cells in the pancreas much as they would be against a \\nforeign invader, like a virus. \\n‘These T cells have somehow already learnt to get halfway’ toward becoming \\nautoreactive cells, says Bonifacio, whose team reports its findings today in Science \\nTranslational Medicine. \\nBonifacio cautions that the findings are still preliminary. For one, samples like these \\nfrom infancy are rare, and thus the number of children whose T cells were studied is \\nmodest. For another, although the unusual T cell behavior was entirely absent in kids \\nwho didn’t get autoantibodies later on, it was recorded in only about half who did. \\nStill, the work breaks ground by identifying likely signs of type 1 diabetes studies earlier \\nthan ever, says Kevan Herold, an endocrinologist at Yale University, who studies ways \\nto prevent the condition. ‘The value of this paper is that there’s stuff that can be \\nmeasured even before’ the autoantibodies, agrees Gerald Nepom, director of the \\nImmune Tolerance Network and former director of the Benaroya Research Institute in \\nSeattle, Washington. \\nOne central mystery is what’s causing the changes in these cells so early in life. \\nBonifacio and others have looked exhaustively for environmental drivers of type 1 \\ndiabetes; although there have been hints of various influences, like certain infections, \\n‘the punch line here is that the data’s inconsistent’ across all the studies, says Carla \\nGreenbaum, who chairs Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet, which oversees type 1 diabetes \\ntreatment and prevention trials, and directs the diabetes program at the Benaroya \\nResearch Institute. \\nSo diabetes experts like Greenbaum have their eyes on prevention. Bonifacio is co-\\nleading a study called Pre-POINT-Early, which offers oral insulin to children between 6 \\nmonths and 2 years old; results are expected sometime next year. An oral insulin \\nprevention study by TrialNet, in people with autoantibodies, will be reported in June. \\nHerold hopes to report data in the near future on a study of an antibody called anti-CD3; \\nhe has tested it in newly diagnosed patients and is now trying it as a preventive.”  \\n(Couzin-Frankel, 2017) \\nConclusion \\n“Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia \\nresulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action or both” (Bruno, Merletti, et al, \\n1990).

These tests are named A1c and \\nfructosamine (fruk-TOES-ah-meen), and glycosylated protein (gly-COS-el-lay-ted PRO- \\nteen). These tests are not substitutes for checking your blood sugar level at home. Your \\nhome blood sugar monitoring measures your blood sugar level at the very moment that \\nthe sample is obtained. These new tests give different information about your health, \\nand add a new dimension to our ability to evaluate diabetes. \\nA1c: The A1c test was developed in the late 1970’s. Other names that have been used \\nto describe the same test are glycosylated hemoglobin, and hemoglobin A1c. This test \\ngives information about your average blood sugar level during the past two or three \\nmonths. The normal values for this test vary depending upon the lab, and you must look \\nat the “normal range” or “reference range” that the lab uses to make sense of your \\nresult.1 If your A1c value is higher than the normal range, then we know that your \\naverage blood sugar has been elevated during the past two months. More importantly, if \\nyour recent A1c is lower than your previous value, then we know that you are now doing \\nbetter than before! \\nFructosamine:  The fructosamine test has been developed more recently. Fructosamine \\nis a term referring to the linking of blood sugar onto protein molecules in the \\nbloodstream. Fructosamine levels have been shown to change more rapidly than \\nglycohemoglobin. Your fructosamine value depends upon your average blood sugar \\nlevel during the past three weeks. Therefore, it might be able to detect changes in \\ndiabetic control earlier than the glycohemoglobin. \\nThe fructosamine test could be viewed as complementary to the glycohemoglobin, since \\nthe two tests are different reflections of diabetes control: glycohemoglobin looks back \\napproximately eight weeks, and the fructosamine test looks back about three weeks. \\n \\nOther tests:   Other tests similar to the fructosamine test have been proposed; the \\nglycosylated protein test is an example of another test that was suggested. \\nUnfortunately, these newer tests are less reliable than originally hoped, and seems'),\n",

By using this test, together with \\nyour  home blood sugar monitoring, you and your health care team will have a much \\nbetter idea about how your diabetes is doing. \\n A1C laboratory tests are now standardized. In the past, the A1C test was not recommended for \\ndiagnosis of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes because the many different types of A1C tests could give \\nvaried results. The accuracy has been improved by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization \\nProgram (NGSP), which developed standards for the A1C tests. \\nAppendix B Estimated Percentage of Adults with Diagnosed Diabetes, \\nby Age and State, United States, data from 2014.
